# calculator

This is an HTML, CSS and Javascript exercise into a browser based calculator with all the functionality of a physical desktop calculator.

-Basic Arithmetic functions
-Errors for divisible by 0, empty operations, etc.
-Keeps a running total as user continues to enter numbers/operators
-Browser feedback in the form of visual and audio cues of inputs and positioning.
-keyboard support
-backspace option for input errors
-Floating point number input capabilities
-CLEAR functionality
